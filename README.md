# Exoplanet Case Study

This project explores how different definitions of “habitability” affect the identification of exoplanet candidates.

Using NASA-derived exoplanet data accessed via Google BigQuery, I apply filtering, ranking, and joins to narrow thousands of observations down to a small, interpretable result set.

The goal of this case study is not only to demonstrate SQL proficiency, but to show how analytical choices shape conclusions.


### Interpretation & Implications

This analysis highlights an often-overlooked constraint in exoplanet research: distance fundamentally changes feasibility.

Even when planets meet commonly cited “habitable” criteria, the distances involved remain immense. Using Voyager 1 as a familiar benchmark, travel times to nearby candidate exoplanets are measured in millions of years. This is not a practical limitation that can be solved through incremental improvements, but a structural one.

The purpose of this case study is not to suggest that interstellar travel is currently achievable, but to demonstrate how analytical framing matters. By combining SQL-based filtering with scale-aware visualization, the results show that identifying promising targets is only the first step. Reaching them requires a reimagining of propulsion, energy, and exploration strategies rather than extensions of existing methods.

In this sense, the analysis mirrors real-world decision-making: data can identify possibilities, but context determines viability.
