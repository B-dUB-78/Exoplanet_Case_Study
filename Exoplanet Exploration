# Exoplanet Case Study

This project explores how different definitions of “habitability” affect the identification of exoplanet candidates.

Using NASA-derived exoplanet data accessed via Google BigQuery, I apply filtering, ranking, and joins to narrow thousands of observations down to a small, interpretable result set.

The goal of this case study is not only to demonstrate SQL proficiency, but to show how analytical choices shape conclusions.
